## 📈 Analysis Summary
- The password is well-structured with **strong length** and **diverse character types** (lowercase, numbers, symbol).
- It avoids basic pitfalls like using only letters or only numbers.
- However, **too many consecutive lowercase letters** and **some repetition** lowered the overall score slightly.
- Adding a **single uppercase letter** could improve the balance and push the score higher.

---

## 💡 Recommendations for Improvement
- Break up **consecutive lowercase characters** (e.g., `abcdefg` → `Ab#cDef1g`).
- Add at least **1 uppercase letter**.
- Introduce another **symbol**, especially in the middle, to increase entropy.
- Minimize **repetition** of characters when possible.

---

## 🏁 Conclusion
- The password is classified as **strong** and adheres to most **security best practices**.
- With a few minor adjustments, it could reach an **exceptional** rating (85–100%).
